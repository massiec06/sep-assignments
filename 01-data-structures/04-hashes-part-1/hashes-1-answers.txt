Doubling the size of your underlying array would be a bad idea because it wouldn't be effective.
The addition of one new item to the array would could cause a vary large increase in the array size very
quickly and it's possible for the array to start using up large amounts of memory from the computer and causing
the computer to start acting slow. Using prime numbers is less likely to cause a collision than doubling because it's
not favoring a particular result.
