Doubling the size of your underlying array would be a bad idea because it wouldn't be effective.
The addition of one new item to the array would could cause a vary large increase in the array size very
quickly and it's possible for it to happen again. Two new additions could increase the size of
the array for no reason. This would cause delays as the array would need to be searched 
in order for every time the data is accessed and every time the data is re-arranged or re-indexed causing further delay.
